<p>I'm a generalist and a systems enthusiast, fascinated by life's systems - culture and social behavior, business and economic models. I've worked on 
a variety entrepreneurial projects, mostly software based, and I want to continue to work on interesting projects that further my understanding of the systems
in society, as well as projects that ultimately impact human self-actualization.</p>
