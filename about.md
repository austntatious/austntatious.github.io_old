<p>I'm a generalist and a systems enthusiast, fascinated by life's systems - culture and social behavior, business and economic models. I've worked on 
a variety entrepreneurial projects, mostly software based, and I want to continue to work on interesting projects that further my understanding of the systems
in society, as well as projects that ultimately impact human self-actualization.</p>
<p>I've recently been spending a lot of time thinking about urban design and how the design of the spaces we live in greatly affect our communities, which in turn greatly impacts individual happiness. Our individual identities is tied to the context of our society and the communities that we live in. The way apartments, neighborhoods, and other spaces have been designed hasn't changed in decades, and as more of the population migrates to metropolitan areas, we need to focus more on how to ensure the cities of the future allow us to live our lives in a fulfilling manner.</p>
<p>My other recent fixations are more specific to the fields of sociology, psychology, and philosophy. I'm curious about the process of self-development and how to effectively navigate the winding path to actualization. How do mold our body into it's most ideal form? How do we better ourselves if we're just battling against ourselves? I'm also curious about the nature of compatibility and the essence of relationship or connection. Lastly, how do we teach people about self-actualization so that they too can come closer to their true and best selves? I'll cover some of these topics and anything else I find interesting in this blog. And feel free to signup for the mailing list for new articles and other updates.</p>
